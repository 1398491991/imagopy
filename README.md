# ImagoPy
This is a python wrapper for [Imago OCR](https://github.com/ggasoftware/imago).
Its purpose is to faciliate the utilization of the Imago OCR APIs in
Python-based cheminformatic projects. A typical use case would be combining this wrapper
with [RDKit](https://rdkit.org) as demonstrated in [this tutorial](/example/imagopy.ipynb).
